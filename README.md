The Coding Task

Create an iPhone app that will fetch the current exchange rate of Bitcoin in EUR. The app contains 2 screens and a Today Widget:

List screen displays the historical price of Bitcoin for the last 2 weeks, including today. The Bitcoin price for today is realtime, and itâ€™s updated every 60 seconds. Tapping on a certain day navigates to the detail screen
Detail screen displays the price of Bitcoin on that day in EUR, USD and GBP and the user can go back to the list screen
Today Widget displays the Bitcoin price in EUR for today and updates it in real time - every 10 seconds
